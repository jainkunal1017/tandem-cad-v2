Having even a super concise doc, what the part is, why it's there, would help them come in familiar and actually contribute better.

I end up digging through the model tree just trying to figure out what someone else did. And if things aren't labeled clearly, it becomes a guessing game. Change one feature and suddenly everything downstream breaks.",

I love your approach of using AI to trace design steps, connect related files, and surface what matters. Pulling in context like FEA runs or cut sheets, things that influenced key decisions, makes a huge difference.",
